Repository that contains part of my sports analytics and prediction portfolio.

## Notebooks

This project uses Jupyter Notebooks in order to extract the desired statistics from the players. At the moment of writing, there are two Jupyter Notebooks being used:

1. [batter-data-extract.ipynb](./Notebooks/Player%20Data/batter-data-extract.ipynb)
2. [pitcher-data-extract.ipynb](./Notebooks/Player%20Data/pitcher-data-extract.ipynb)
3. [team-batting-data.ipynb](./Notebooks/Team%20Data/team-batting-data.ipynb)
4. [team-pitching-data.ipynb](./Notebooks/Team%20Data/team-pitching-data.ipynb)
