# MLB-Stats

Repository that contains part of my sports analytics and prediction portfolio.

## Notebooks

This project uses Jupyter Notebooks in order to extract the desired statistics from the players. At the moment of writing, there are two Jupyter Notebooks being used:

1. [batter-data-extract.ipynb](./Notebooks/batter-data-extract.ipynb)
2. [pitcher-data-extract.ipynb](./Notebooks/pitcher-data-extract.ipynb)
